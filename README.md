# Living off the Dividend 

While talking about investing and dividends, my friend casually said "The dream is to have so much $VOO I can pay my living expenses with just dividends". Conversation ensued about how many shares of our favorite ETF (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) one would need to make that possible, and between my interest in investing and data skills, I decided to find the answer.

# Methods

1. Read in VOO dividend data from dividendchannel.com
2. Calculate median change in quarterly dividend (4% in this case)
3. Use median change to extrapolate x amount of years and thus, 4x amount of quarters (x = 25 in this case)
4. Assume that a certain fixed amound of new shares will be bought every quarter (8 in this case)
5. Use step 2, 3 and 4 to calculate how much the total dividend pay out will be for every quarter:

	*new payout = old payout * 1.04) * total shares owned*
6. create horizontal lines for living expense options
7. graph total dividend payouts, see where bars cross horizontal lines

# Conclusion

### He will be able to live off the dividend from mid-late 30's onward @ current rate
##### living expenses not adjusted for inflation, real time frame might be different
